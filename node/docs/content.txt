We are very concerned about your privacy and security.
- We have phone numbers and real names of all registered users.
- We keep track of details of any person who contacts you.
- All our users are 18+ year old.
- To contact someone both users (customer and add giver) have to enter Transaction Mode, during which we hold transaction's location and participants info.
    If there is no 'Success' status set, we call both participants. If we can't reach any... SOMETHING BAD HAPPENED.
