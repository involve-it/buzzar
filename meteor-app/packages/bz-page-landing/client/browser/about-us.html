        <i>What is <span class="uppercase bold">crowd-finding (crowdfinding)</span>?</i>

        <br/>

        Think of us as of "Google For People": the way Google lets you search through <b>urls in Web</b>,
        we let you search among <b>real people around you</b>. Like Google has it's ranking system to order url relevancy,
        we have our sophisticated Karma algorithm, phone# verification and other means to rank real posts' credibility.
        <br/>

        Or think of us of an advertisement in a local newspaper, powered by technology and social capabilities,
        that will give another dimension to your post - dimensions binding location, time, person and karma.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        So let local people know if you:
        <ul class="capitalize">
            <li>need immediate help</li>
            <li>offering/looking for a gig/job/service</li>
            <li>have something to sell/buy</li>
            <li>searching for a roommate</li>
            <li>lost/found something</li>
            <li>fundraising money</li>
            <li>anything else that can have URL, bound to your location</li>
        </ul>
        By joining the community you .. of dif things, but at the end of the day it is all about finding (real interactions) with people
