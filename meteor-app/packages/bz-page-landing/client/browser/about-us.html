        <b>What is Buzzar?</b>
      </p>
      <p><u>Buzzar</u> is a next step in community advertisement, powered by technology and social capabilities, that gives
        another dimension to a post - namely <i>web url, location, time and availability</i> bound together.
      </p>
      <p>
        <u>Buzzar</u> is a community, built on humanistic principles of compassion, awareness, consciousness and freedom of
        choice.
      </p>

      <p>
        <u>Buzzar</u> is a tool that aims to help people get a better deal.

        <b>The Problem</b>
      </p>


      <p>
        People can not know who is around them, that is why can miss best opportunities.
        The solution is to give them means to spread and get knowledge about available ads and services around by binding location and internet posts in one place.
        By doing that we present an alternative to internet, agent, and other traditional means of search. Thus the time of
        spare can be possibly converted into deals or at least fun time.
      </p>

      <p><b>So let local people know if you:</b></p>
      <ul class="capitalize">
        <li><a href="/posts/new#need-help">need immediate help</a></li>
        <li><a href="/posts/new#need-help">offering/looking for a gig/job/service</a></li>
        <li><a href="/posts/new#need-help">have something to sell/buy</a></li>

      </ul>
