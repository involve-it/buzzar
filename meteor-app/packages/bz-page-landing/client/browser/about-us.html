            <p><i>What is <span class="uppercase bold">crowd-finding (crowdfinding)</span>?</i></p>
    
            <p>Think of us as of "Google For People": the way Google lets you search through <b>urls in Web</b>,
            we let you search among <b>real people around you</b>. Like Google has it's ranking system to order url relevancy,
            we have our sophisticated Karma algorithm, phone# verification and other means to rank real posts' credibility.
            </p>
    
            <p>Or think of us of an advertisement in a local newspaper, powered by technology and social capabilities,
            that will give another dimension to your post - dimensions binding location, time, person and karma.
            </p>
            
            <strong>So let local people know if you:</strong>
