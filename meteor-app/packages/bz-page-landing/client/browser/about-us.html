      Buzzar - instant posts bound to location.
    </h3>

        <b>What is Buzzar?</b>
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Buzzar</b> is a community, built on humanistic principles of compassion, awareness, consciousness and freedom of choice.
      </p>
      <p>
        Buzzar is a tool that aims to help people get a better deal.
      </p>
      <!--<p>Think of us as of "Google For People": the way Google lets you search through <b>urls in Web</b>,
      we let you search among <b>real people around you</b>. Like Google has it's ranking system to order url relevancy,
      we have our sophisticated Karma algorithm, phone# verification and other means to rank real posts' credibility.
      </p>-->

      <p>Buzzar is an analogy of advertisement in a local newspaper, powered by technology and social capabilities,
        that will give another dimension to your online post or url - namely location, time and availability bound
        together.
      </p>

      <b>The Problem</b>

      <p>
        People can not know who surrounds them and that is why can miss best opportunities.
        The solution is to give them means to spread and get knowledge about available ads and posts around them by
        binding location and their internet posts in one application.
        By doing that we present an alternative to internet, agent, and other traditional means of search. The time of
        spare can be easily converted into deals or at least fun time.
      </p>
      <strong>So let local people know if you:</strong>
